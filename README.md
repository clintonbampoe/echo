## Project principles

- **Docs first** Decisions, requirements, and designs are recorded in documentation before implementation.  
- **Modular design** Features are split into independent modules to enable safe iteration and reuse.  
- **Traceability** Every change should be traceable to a requirement, issue, or design note.  
- **Documentation is code** Treat docs and process artifacts as first-class deliverables that must be kept current.
