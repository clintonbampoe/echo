# Persona 003

role: **clerk**  
owner: **dev team**  
status: **draft**  

name: **Joseph Tetteh**  
age: **39**

## Snapshot

Joseph is a friendly, energetic church clerk who handles contributions and attendance during services. He's approachable and quick to hekp, but often under pressure to record many small details in a short time. He values speed and simplicity in the tools he uses, because his focus is on people and events happening around him.

## Typical day

Joseph spends most of his time during services on his phone, entering contributions and attendance while moving between people. After events, he uses a desktop to tidy up records. He wants forms that are short, forgiving and easy to use on mobile, especially when the connection is slow.

## Top Goals

- Record contributions quickly without mistakes
- Tag entries correctly so Finance can reconcile later.
- Finish attendance recording in one session without interruptions

## Main Frustrations

- Long forms with too many required fields
- Confusing tagging that slows him down or causes errors
- Permission errors that block simple tasks and force him to ask for help

## Tech & Environment

Mobile-first, often on low bandwidth. Needs large touch targets, minimal typing and clear error messages. Desktop is secondary, used for organization and catch-up work.

## Success & Acceptance Criteria

Joseph can record multiple contributions in under two minutes, complete attendance smoothly and avoid errors that create extra work for Finance or Admin

## Design Implications (What to build for Joseph)

- Default tags and inline validation to reduce mistakes
- Compact mobile forms with step-by-step reveal
- Permission error messages that explain what went wrong and how to fix it

I'm standing at the back of the hall on my phone -- I need to finish quickly so I can get back to the service
