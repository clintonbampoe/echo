# Persona 004

role: **viewer**  
owner: **dev team**  
status: **draft**  

name: **Samuel Adjei**  
age: 50

## Snapshot

Samuel is a seasoned auditor who volunteers his expertie to help the church maintain transparency and accountability. He's patient, thorough and has a sharp eye for detail. He approaches records with a mindset of **"trust but verify"** and expects systems to give him complete, reliable information without forcing him to chase misssing pieces.

## Typical day

Samuel spends most of his time on a desktop, reviewing reports and searching through records. He often exports data to spreadsheets so he can run his own checks. He doesn't interact with the system daily, but when he does, it's usually for deep dives into specific transactions or exports.

## Top Goals

- Find and review transactions quickly with full context
- Verify who approved changed and when, without ambiguity
- Export audit-ready data that leadership and external reviewers can trust

## Main Frustrations

- Exports that miss critical fields like approver IDs or timestamps
- Audit trails that are incomplete or hard to navigate
- Dashboards cluttered with irrelevant details that hide what matters

## Tech & Environment

Desktop-first, comfortable with filters, searches and spreadsheets. Needs clear labeling, strong contrast and keyboard navigation for efficiency.

## Success & Acceptance Criteria

Samuel can locate a transaction with a few clicks, see the full approval trail and export a complete record for audit without needing to ask anyone else for clarification.

## Design Implications (What to build for Samuel)

- Focused dashboards that highlight the essentials for review

**Representative quote**  
"If I cannot see who approved it and when, the record is not complete -- and that means I can't sign off"
