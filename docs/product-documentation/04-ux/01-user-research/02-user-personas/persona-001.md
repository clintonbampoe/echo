## Snapshot

Kwame is a calm, methodica church administrator who runs the office for a busy parish. He's practical, detail-focused and prefers tools that let him find and fix problems quickly. He values clear records and dislikes vague messages or scattered settings that force him to chase answers.

## Typical day

Kwame spends mornings at his desktop handling user requests, checking logs, and updating settings. During events he uses his phone for quick checks and to confirm that things are working. He likes short, factual UI text and exportable logs he can share with leadership.

## Top goals

- resolve permission or configuration issues fast without escalating.
- Keep clear, exportable audit trails for leadership and compliance.
- Reduce repetitive support work so the office runs smoothly.

## Main Frustrations

- Settings split across multiple screens that slow fixes
- Generic error messages that do not explain the next steps.
- Audit logs that are hard to filter or export.

## Tech environment

Desktop-first for heavy work; mobile for quick checks. Comfortable with admin panels and spreadsheets. Needs searchable lists, filters, bulk actions and clear export options.

## Success & Acceptance Criteria

Fewer support tickets, quick fixes in a single flow, and audit entries that answer **"who, when, why"** at a glance.

## Design Implications (What to build for Kwame)

- A single role-management view with filters and bulk actions.
- Permission error messages that explain why and suggest next steps.
- Exportable, filterable audit logs with **"What I changed"** notes.  

**Representative Quote**  
"If I can fix it in one place and show who did it, I can get back to the rest of my day."
