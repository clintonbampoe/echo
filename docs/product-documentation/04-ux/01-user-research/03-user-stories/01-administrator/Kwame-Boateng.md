# Kwame Boateng

- As an admin, I want to fix a clerk's permisiion issue in one place, so that they can continue posting contributions without delay
- As an admin, I want to see a clear audit trail of every role change, so that I can prove who made changes and when
- As an admin, I want permission error messages to explain next steps, so that users do not flood me with support tickets
