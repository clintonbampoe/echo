- As an accountant, I want deposits to include clerk IDs and approval metadata, so that I can reconcile accounts without chasing details
- As an accountant, I want to approve or reject transactions with a visible trail, so that audits are straightforward and defensible
- As an accountant, I want to export complete financial reports, so that leadership can trust the numbers without extra cleanup
