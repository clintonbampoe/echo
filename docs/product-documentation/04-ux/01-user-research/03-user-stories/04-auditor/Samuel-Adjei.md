- As an auditor, I want to search for a transaction or record and see its full approval trail in a few clicks, so that I can verify compliance quickly
- As an auditor, I want exports to include all audit metadata, so that I can prepare complete reports for external review
- As an auditor, I want dashboards to highlight essential details, so that I dont waste time filtering through clutter
