# Joseph Tetteh

- As a clerk, I want contribution forms to come with default common tags, so that I can record entries quickly during services
- As a clerk, I want inline validation that catches mistakes early, so that I don't waste time fixing errors later
- As a clerk, I want permission errors to tell me what went wrong, so that I know how to fix it or who to contact
