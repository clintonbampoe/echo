# UX Overview

This is the practical index for the `ux/` docs. It contains an overview of everything in the UX docs and how the pieces connect together.

## Main Sections

### User Research

Contains evidence, user stories, user personas, pain points and insightful data on our users and stakeholders.  
Contains:  

- Pain points
- User suggestions
- User Personas
- User Stories

### Workflows / User Journeys

This defines steps, data and permission gates. It includes step-by-step maps of how users complete tasks. Each flow shows steps, who does them, what data is written or rea, where approvals or permission checks happen and common error cases. Each flow is written as a plain list with decision points and edge cases.

### Wireframes & Interaction Notes

This section shows screens and field rules. It contains quick screen sketches that match the workflows. Each sketch shows the required fields, the validatation rules, which roles can view or edit, and exact wording for buttons and error messages(*subject to change). They're low fidelity to make changes easy to make. It's main purpose is to show contributors and devs how screens should work without worrying about the details.

### Design Principles

This section contains guidelines that help keep the UX design consistent and accessible. It keeps a short list of rules that guide UI decisions-- behavior, error handling, confirmation patterns, etc. Use these rules to resolve unclear design choices and as the checklist to implement new design elements.

### Edge Cases

Contains documented edge cases, error handling, compliance notes and any other rules or anomalies that were encountered inside the relevant workflow(*userJourneys*) or wireframe annotations. This keeps accessibility and security notes next to the screens they affect so nothing is missed during implementation.

### Backlog

This is just a log of what we're going to build next and how we're going to measure success.
