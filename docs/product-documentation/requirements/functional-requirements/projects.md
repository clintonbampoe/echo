## Project Fund Management

- **PR-FM001:** The system must allow authorized users to allocate funds to projects with fields for project name, purpose, amount, and date.

- **PR-FM002:** The system must record payments and advances related to projects, linking them to specific expenditure records.

- **PR-FM003:** The system must track project progress against allocated budget and completion stages.

- **PR-FM004:** The system must provide search and filter options for project fund records by project, category, or date.

- **PR-FM005:** The system must maintain audit logs of all project fund allocations and updates, showing who made changes and when.

## Fundraising Integration

- **PR-FI001:** The system must link special appeals, pledges, or donations directly to projects.

- **PR-FI002:** The system must track pledges with fields for contributor, amount pledged, fulfillment status, and due date.

- **PR-FI003:** The system must compare pledged vs. actual contributions for each project.

- **PR-FI004:** The system must generate periodic summaries of fundraising linked to projects (monthly, yearly).

- **PR-FI005:** The system must provide alerts or flags for overdue or incomplete pledge fulfillment.

**Reason for placement:** Fundraising is integrated under Projects because in this system fundraising is always tied to a specific initiative. This ensures pledges and donations are directly linked to project outcomes, making reporting, accountability, and audit trails clear and avoiding “orphan” fundraising records with no destination.
