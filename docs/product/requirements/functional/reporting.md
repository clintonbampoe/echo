# Requirements: Reporting

## Financial Statements

- **RP-FS001:** The system must generate structured financial statements including, but not limited to, Receipts & Payments, Trial Balance, Cash Book, and Balance Sheet. *// Improvement: “including, but not limited to” leaves room for flexibility to add new or custom statements later.*

- **RP-FS002:** The system must provide summaries of income, expenditure, and balances across all financial accounts (cash, bank, designated funds). 
  
  *// Clarification: In this context, “accounts” are financial repositories tracked in Core Accounting, not member accounts. Examples include cash on hand, bank accounts, and restricted/designated funds.*

- **RP-FS003:** The system must ensure financial statements are compliant with standard accounting formats used by the church and auditors.

- **RP-FS004:** The system must allow statements to be generated for configurable periods (daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly). 
  
  *// Improvement: Adding “daily” provides flexibility for short-term monitoring and operational reviews.*

## Analytical Reports

- **RP-AR001:** The system must produce periodic analysis of income and expenditure trends.

- **RP-AR002:** The system must generate member contribution and dues analysis, with breakdowns by category (tithe, offering, dues), group (ministries, fellowships, committees), or time period (weekly, monthly, yearly). 
  
  *// Clarification: This ensures leadership can see both individual and group giving patterns, track changes over time, and identify trends in financial participation.*

- **RP-AR003:** The system must provide project expenditure vs. budget comparisons, highlighting variances.

- **RP-AR004:** The system must support external reporting requirements (e.g., circuit or diocese returns).

- **RP-AR005:** The system must provide search and filter options for analytical reports by member, group, project, or date.

## Audit & Export

- **RP-AE001:** The system must enable export of reports in standard formats (PDF, Excel, CSV).

- **RP-AE002:** The system must maintain complete audit logs of all reporting actions, showing who generated, exported, or modified reports and when. 

- *// Clarification: Audit logs here ensure transparency and accountability by recording every reporting action, making it possible to trace decisions and outputs back to individuals or teams.*

- **RP-AE003:** The system must provide secure access controls so only authorized users can generate or export sensitive reports.
